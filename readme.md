# ChainerWing
GUI deep learning IDE based on chainer.

!!This project has not been released.!!

Test is not sufficient, there is no manual.

Although the net saving function is implemented, 

the current format is not necessarily effective in the future.

The interface may change greatly.


It is scheduled to be released in April 2017.
